# Css to the rescue! 🦸🏼‍♂️
 This course is part of the Web Development Minor.
 The goal of the course is to learn all the unknown parts of CSS

# The assignments

We think the web is an exciting place. In recent years CSS has become an incredibly powerful language. Many of its possibiliets haven’t been explored in full yet. Some parts of the CSS spec are largely ignored, while others are so big and powerful that we don’t yet understand what we can do with it. To you the fun task of exploring the uncharted parts of CSS.

On this page we explain the assignments, the contexts, the restrictions and the methodlogy we want you to work with.

## The *Selector First* CSS Methodology

You _have_ to work with the so called *Selector First* CSS Methodology. This means that you _have to_ use a wide variety of CSS selectors. ID’s are only allowed to trigger the `:target` selector. If you really need them, you are allowed to use a few classes. In order to differentiate between
