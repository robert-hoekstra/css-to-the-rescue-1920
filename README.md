# The assignments
![assignments](https://github.com/robert-hoekstra/css-to-the-rescue-1920/blob/master/images/assignment.jpg?raw=true)

We think the web is an exciting place. In recent years CSS has become an incredibly powerful language. Many of its possibiliets haven‚Äôt been explored in full yet. Some parts of the CSS spec are largely ignored, while others are so big and powerful that we don‚Äôt yet understand what we can do with it. To you the fun task of exploring the uncharted parts of CSS.

On this page we explain the assignments, the contexts, the restrictions and the methodlogy we want you to work with.

## The assignment I chose

- (x) Responsive restauraunt menu [Here‚Äôs some raw HTML you may use](../assignments/menu.html)

_You can use the provided content and HTML, or you can create your own. Of course you are allowed to change the HTML when needed._

## The contexts I added to the project

You have to add two extra contexts to your site

- [x] print-stylesheet
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion
- [x] dark-mode
- [x] input type

## Two restrictions I picked
![rules](https://github.com/robert-hoekstra/css-to-the-rescue-1920/blob/master/images/rules.jpg?raw=true)

You have to work with _at least_ two of these restrictions.

- [x] Two colours
- [x] Less than 5kb CSS *(not as an excuses for lazyness, hahaha)*
- [x] Responsive without media queries
- [x] Design responds to weather/time 
- [x] Design responds to battery level



## The *Selector First* CSS Methodology
![code](https://github.com/robert-hoekstra/css-to-the-rescue-1920/blob/master/images/code.jpg?raw=true)

I _have_ to work with the so called *Selector First* CSS Methodology. This means that I _have to_ use a wide variety of CSS selectors. ID‚Äôs are only allowed to trigger the `:target` selector. If I really need them, I am allowed to use a few classes. In order to differentiate between.
